# React + TypeScript + Vite Project - NEWS AGGREGATOR APP

## Overview

This project is a React application built with TypeScript and powered by Vite for a fast and modern development experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your local development environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 20.14.0 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

# Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
- `public/`: Static assets and the HTML template.
- `node_modules/`: Auto-generated by npm, contains all the dependencies.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for npm, lists the project's dependencies and scripts.
- `vite.config.ts`: Configuration file for Vite.

# Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build locally.

# Contributing

If you wish to contribute to this project, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the application directory:

   ```bash
   cd <app-directory>
   ```

3. Install the npm packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To start the application in development mode, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

# Using Docker

### Create a file named as Dockerfile and put below

1. Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image

### FROM node:20.14.0

2. Set the working directory in the container

```bash
WORKDIR /src
```

3. Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory

```bash
COPY package\*.json ./
```

4. Install app dependencies

```bash
RUN npm install
```

5. Copy the rest of your application code to the working directory

```bash
COPY . .
```

6. Now build your application

```bash
RUN npm run build
```

7. Expose a port to communicate with the React app

```bash
EXPOSE 5173
```

8. Start your React app

```bash
CMD ["npm", "run", "preview"]
```

### Now open terminal to the application directory

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build . -t app-name:v1.0
```

2. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 sample-project:v1.0
```

The application will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

3. To run the container in a detached state, use:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 sample-project:v1.0
```

- Check Running Containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

- Stop Running Container:

```bash
docker stop <container-id>
```

- Remove Container:

```bash
docker rm <container-id>
```

- Remove Image:
